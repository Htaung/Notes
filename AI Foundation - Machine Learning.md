classified or identified flower in an image

feed a maching image of flower doing training process to identify  dandelions, sunflowers, daisies, tulips and roses

Machine Learning since 1950
- subset of AI that applied math to large datasets to find trends and patterns while mapping input and output
- age, location, no. bed room => what will selling price be?

Mapping uncovered bet input and output are stored in math model, simply called model
- Models are depicted as brain => meant to simulate human intelligence
- mass

-Machine Learnng wide separated coz of
big data, easier acces to large datasets needed to train maching learning model and cloud which bring facilities with easy to use machine learning services
and access to powerful compute power

- Linear Algebra
- Basic Equation
- Probability

## 3 common Maching Learning Techniques
- Reinforcement learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning
- trains model with labeled data
 - knows i/p and o/p data
 - teach machine to predict future o/p as new data comes in
 
Ex
- Cost of home in California 
- machine trained on datasets, includes
 - Latt and long
 - Age
 - Rooms
 - Population
 - Households
 - Median income
 - Ocean Proximity
 - Value
#### regression problem
machine stuies the labeled data to find patterns and learn how to predict home values so called regression problem coz
it predicts a number or continuous value in mathematics


#### Classification Techniques
- predicts discrete responsess (eg. yes or no values)
- data tagging, categorization or separated into groups or classes
- Flower identification Case Study - Multi-class label classification coz we will train model to tag the type of flower found in image

#### Unsupervised learning
- doesn't use labled data, instead it groups/interpret data based only on i/p data
- clustering is comon unsupervised learning techniques
- the hospital industry often clusters or segment customers which allow them to tailor their marketing strategy to gain loyal 
customer and competitive advantage


#### Reinforcement Learning
- allow machine to learn through trial and error learning
- doesn not rely on defined dataset
- operate in dynamic env
- learn through experience
eg, train a dog with positive and negative reinforcement learns - behavior that will get is most treats
- robotic chess player,  robot


LLM - Large Language Model and generative AI

Traditional Machine Learning
- Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Clustering

Use case
- Fraud Detection, Customer churn prediction, Inventory Management, Demand FOrecasting
- ML come in shine - Focused, Efficient, Grounded in data driven insights

Simply Models
- Train Faster
- Cost less to maintain
- Deployed anywhere

Interpretability
- mean you can explain why a model made a specific prediction

ML Foundation
- Gathering data
- Cleaning it
- Training Models
- Evaluating Performance
- Improving overtime

ML - Deep Learning - Generative AI


ML life cycle
Standard stages to follow

SDLC Stages
- Problem info and understanding
 - explore current business process to identify where maching learning adds value
 - is ML an ethical solution to the problem?
 - whar are i/p and o/p?
 - What prediction error rates will you accept?
 - What do you required for accuracy perpective
- Data collection and preparation
 - Souce the data you needed => internal data sources, provided data, open source or public datastore, purchased data
 - raw data is not in a state that a machine can learn from
 - Spend time annotating and wrangling the data
 - Label data
 - Remove irrelevant features
 - Toss outliers
 - Transform data
 - input missing values
- Model training and testing
Once the data is ready split the process into 3 data subset => training (80%), validating(10%), testing data(10%)
After select the data, select ML algorithm and point it to your process data to start training process
iterate and experiment, fine tue, evaluate,  until you land well performing model that you place your model into production
- Model deployment and maintenance
 - once model is ready setup cadence for retraining, monitoring overall performance
